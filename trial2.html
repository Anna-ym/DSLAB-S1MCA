<h4 style="font-family: cursive; color:chocolate">Request-Response Cycle: The web browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the web server when a user enters a URL or clicks a link. The web server receives the request, processes it, and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).

Rendering Content: The browser interprets the response and renders the content for the user. It displays the web page in a readable and interactive format.

Communication Protocol: Both the browser and server communicate using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, ensuring a standardized exchange of data.

Dynamic Content: For dynamic websites, the server may execute backend scripts (e.g., PHP, Python) to generate content before sending it to the browser.</h4></pre>

<p style="font-family: cursive; color:chocolate"> A <u>Web Browser</u> is a software application that allows users to view and interact with websites on the Internet. It retrieves data from a web server, processes it, and displays it in a readable and interactive format for the user.<br><br>
<b>Features of a Web Browser:</b><br>
HTML Rendering: Renders web pages written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
Multimedia Support: Supports images, videos, and other multimedia content.<br>
Tabs: Allows multiple websites to be opened in different tabs.<br>
Extensions: Supports browser extensions for additional functionality (e.g., ad blockers, password managers).<br>
Security: Includes features like private browsing, HTTPS encryption, and security certificates.<br><br>
<b>Use Cases of a Web Browser:</b><br>
Browsing the Web: Accessing websites and viewing content.<br>
Online Shopping: Visiting e-commerce websites to browse and buy products.<br>
Social Media: Logging into social networks to connect with friends and communities.<br>
Online Banking: Accessing and managing bank accounts securely over the web.<br>
Web Apps: Using online applications like email clients, office suites, and file storage<br>
<br><br>
A <u>Web Server</u> is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers web content to users through the Internet. It listens for requests from clients (web browsers), processes those requests, and sends the required files (such as HTML, images, and videos) back to the browser.<br><br>

<b>Features of a Web Server:</b><br>
HTTP/HTTPS Protocol: Communicates using HTTP or HTTPS to send and receive requests.<br>
Content Storage: Stores web pages, scripts, images, and other media.<br>
Response Handling: Processes incoming requests and returns the appropriate response (such as HTML pages or images).<br>
Logging: Logs details of every request, such as IP addresses, timestamps, and requested URLs.<br>
Security: Handles security measures like SSL/TLS encryption for secure HTTPS connections.<br><br>
<b>Use Cases of a Web Server:</b><br>
Website Hosting: Stores and serves the files that make up a website.<br>
API Hosting: Hosts backend APIs that allow client applications to interact with data.<br>
File Sharing: Serves downloadable files, like documents, videos, or images.<br>
Web Applications: Hosts web-based applications that perform actions and store data on the server.<br>
E-commerce: Stores product listings, user accounts, and order data for online stores.</p>
