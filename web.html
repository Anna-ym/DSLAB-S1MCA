    <p style="color: aliceblue;">The Client-Server Model is a distributed architecture where clients request services and servers provide them. Clients send requests to servers, which process them and return the results. Clients don’t share resources among themselves but depend on the server.<br> Common examples include email systems and the World Wide Web, where clients (like browsers or email apps) interact with servers to access content or send data.The process of interacting with servers through a browser involves several steps. Here's a breakdown of the steps taken when you enter a URL in a browser and receive the website data:<br>

1. User Enters the URL (Uniform Resource Locator): The user types a website address (e.g., www.example.com) into the browser's address bar.<br>

2. DNS (Domain Name System) Lookup: The browser sends a request to the DNS server to resolve the human-readable URL into an IP address (since computers use IP addresses to identify and connect to each other).<br>

3. DNS Server Resolves the Address: The DNS server looks up the domain name and returns the IP address of the web server hosting the requested website.<br>

4. Browser Sends HTTP/HTTPS Request: The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the IP address of the web server to fetch the website’s data. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (the secure version) is the protocol used for communication between the browser (client) and the web server (server).<br>

5. Server Sends Website Files: The server processes the request and sends the necessary website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) back to the browser.<br>

6. Rendering the Website: The browser renders the files and displays the website to the user.<br></p>


<center><h2 id="Http-Http Request" style="background-color: antiquewhite;"">Http Request</h2></center>
<center><img src="ImageOfHTTPRequestResponse.png" align="center" height="300"><br></center>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a fundamental protocol of the Internet, enabling the transfer of data between a client and a server. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is an application protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.HTTP is a request-response protocol, which means that for every request sent by a client (typically a web browser), the server responds with a corresponding response. The basic flow of an HTTP request-response cycle is as follows:

Client sends an HTTP request: The client (usually a web browser) initiates the process by sending an HTTP request to the server. This request includes a request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), the target URI (Uniform Resource Identifier, e.g., a URL), headers, and an optional request body.<br>
Server processes the request: The server receives the request and processes it based on the requested method and resource. This may involve retrieving data from a database, executing server-side scripts, or performing other operations.<br>
Server sends an HTTP response: After processing the request, the server sends an HTTP response back to the client. The response includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), response headers, and an optional response body containing the requested data or content.<br>
Client processes the response: The client receives the server's response and processes it accordingly.<br></p>

<center><img src="Web-Applications-types-and-components.png" align="center" height="300" width="500"><br></center>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">Web application architecture is a mechanism that gives us a clarification that how the connection is established between the client and the server. It determines how the components in an application communicate with each other. It doesn't matter what is the size and the complexity level of the application is, they all follow the same principle only the details may differ. 

In technical terms, when a user makes a request on a website, various components of the applications, user interfaces, middleware systems, databases, servers, and the browser interact with each other. Web Application Architecture is a framework that ties up this relation together and maintains the interaction between these components. 

When a user interacts with a website and gets the response back from the server's end, the whole process executes within a few seconds.<br> The most important thing we need to notice here is the code which has been passed to the browser.<br> This code may or may not have particular instructions telling the browser how to respond with respect to the different types of user inputs.<br> That's why a web application architecture includes all the sub-components and external applications interchanges for an entire software application.<br> A web application architecture has to deal with the reliability, scalability, security, and robustness due to a large amount of global network traffic.<br> </p>

<center><h2 id="Types of Web Content" style="background-color: antiquewhite;"">Types of Web Content</h2></center>
<center><img src="R.jpg" align="center" height="300" width="500"><br></center>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">Hundreds. Maybe thousands. If it can be consumed online and vaguely resembles information, someone will call it content. 

We’re talking everything from full-blown video essays to interactive pasta quizzes. (Yes, those exist. No, I’m not linking to one.) <br>But, like many other things in life, just because you can make every type of content doesn’t mean you should.<br>

In reality, only a handful of formats consistently pull their weight.These are the ones that show up in search, spark engagement, build trust and help people get something done. They’re not effective because they’re trendy; they’re effective because they work.Marketing page content. Your homepage, About page, and landing pages are all types of marketing pages. Marketing page content communicates information about your brand to current or potential customers. These pages often contain multimedia content elements like photos, illustrations, graphics, or video.
Product or service page content. Product or service page content explains the value of particular products or services, may include posted answers to customer questions, and encourages purchases through product reviews. Product pages typically include a call to action (CTA), such as an Add to Cart button.
Blog posts. Blog content is article-style, long-form written content that provides information of value to your target audiences. Unlike marketing page content, blog content isn’t necessarily always about your company. Instead, blog posts are often part of a company’s search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketing strategy: They educate or entertain and use specific keywords in an effort to show up in search engine results. 
User-generated content. Some companies post user-generated content (like testimonials or reviews) to their websites. User-generated content encourages purchases through social proof, the phenomenon in which people choose a course of action by mimicking the actions of others.
Case studies. Business-to-business (B2B) companies often use case studies to show their product or service in action with a particular customer. These typically examine a particular customer relationship and show how a product or service helped that customer solve a problem or reach a goal. 
Downloadable content. Some companies will make long-form content (like ebooks and whitepapers) available for download in exchange for your contact information—this is known as gating content. Downloadable content is popular with B2B companies, but it can also be effective for B2C ecommerce companies, as long as the content provides specific value that isn’t readily available through online sources.

<center><img src="dynamic.png" align="center" height="300" width="500"><br><br></center>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">Dynamic Website is a website containing data that can be mutable or changeable.<br> It uses client-side or server scripting to generate mutable content. Like a static website, it also contains HTML data.

Dynamic websites are those websites that changes the content or layout with every request to the webserver.<br> These websites have the capability of producing different content for different visitors from the same source code file.<br> There are two kinds of dynamic web pages i.e. client side scripting and server side scripting.<br> The client-side web pages changes according to your activity on the web page.<br> On the server-side, web pages are changed whenever a web page is loaded.<br>

Example: login & signup pages, application & submission forms, inquiry and shopping cart pages.<br>There are different languages used to create dynamic web pages like PHP, ASP, .NET and JSP. Whenever a dynamic page loads in browser, it requests the database to give information depending upon user's input. On receiving information from the database, the resulting web page is applied to the user after applying the styling codes.<br><br></p>

<center><h2 id="Application Server" style="background-color: antiquewhite;"">Application Server</h2></center>
<center><img src="Application-Server-Architecture.png" align="center" height="300" width="500"><br></center>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">Application Server is a type of server designed to install, operate, and host applications.<br> In the early days of application servers, there was a huge growth in the number of applications brought to the Internet.<br> Those applications became bigger and bigger with the demand for adding more and more functionalities to the application and become more complex to run and maintain.<br> There was a need for some kind of program on the network while it will share application capabilities in an efficient and organized manner.<br>An application server is a program that resides on the server-side, and it’s a server programmer providing business logic behind any application.<br> This server can be a part of the network or the distributed network.<br>

Now, if we would like to know the purpose of a server program, it goes this way:<br>

Ideally, server programs are used to provide their services to the client program that either resides on the same machine or lies on a network.<br></p>
