    <p style="color:rgb(245, 250, 251)">A <u><b>web browser</b></u> and a <u><b>web server</b></u> are two essential components of the <i>World Wide Web</i> that work together to deliver web content to users.<br> While the browser acts as the client-side application, the server operates on the server-side to process and respond to requests.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(245, 250, 251)">A web browser and a web server are two fundamental components of the internet infrastructure, each serving distinct purposes. A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view websites, web pages, and other online content. It interprets the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code of a website and displays it in a user-friendly format. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

On the other hand, a web server is a computer program or hardware device that hosts websites and delivers web pages to users upon request. It stores and processes the website files, manages user requests, and sends the requested web pages to the user's browser. Examples of web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(245, 250, 251)">The terms web browser and web server are very common in the field of computer science and Internet, however people often get confused between the two. The most basic difference between a web browser and a web server is that a web browser is an application software which is used to browse and display webpages available over the Internet, whereas a web server is a software hosted on a dedicated computer which provides these documents when requested by web browsers.
